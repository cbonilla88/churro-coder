## Code Review Instructions

When reviewing the diff:
1. **Focus on logic and correctness** - Check for bugs, edge cases, and potential issues.
2. **Consider readability** - Is the code clear and maintainable?
3. **Evaluate performance** - Are there obvious performance concerns?
4. **Assess test coverage** - Are there adequate tests for these changes?

## Getting the Diff

Run \`${diffCommand}\` to get the changes.

## Output Format

Provide:
1. A brief summary of what the changes do
2. A table of issues found with columns: severity (🔴 high, 🟡 medium, 🟢 low), file:line, issue, suggestion
3. If no issues found, state that the code looks good

Keep the review concise and actionable.`;
