/**
 * CLI-parity built-in subagents.
 *
 * The Claude Code CLI ships built-in subagents, but
 * `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` does NOT — the SDK requires every subagent
 * to be declared via `options.agents`. This constant restores parity so that
 * Claude running inside the Churro Coder app can invoke the same subagent_types
 * (Explore, Plan, general-purpose, etc.) as CLI users.
 *
 * `buildAgentsOption()` in agent-utils.ts seeds this object first, then
 * overlays user/project/plugin-defined agents — so a user-authored `Explore.md`
 * correctly overrides the built-in (matches CLI behavior).
 *
 * Official sources:
 * - https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents
 * - https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/subagents
 *
 * Caveat: Anthropic's docs only formally document `general-purpose`, `Explore`,
 * `Plan`, and `statusline-setup` as built-ins. Their exact system prompts and
 * tool restrictions are undocumented implementation details that may change
 * between CLI versions. The descriptions below are taken from the CLI's Agent
 * tool schema at the time of writing (CLI ~v2.1.118). `claude-code-guide` is
 * observable in the CLI but not in the public docs — included here for
 * completeness.

 * Tools that mutate state — disallowed for read-only subagents (Explore, Plan).

 * added in future SDK versions. Tool names verified against the SDK's
 * AgentDefinition type and the app's tool registry at
 * src/renderer/features/agents/ui/agent-tool-registry.tsx.
